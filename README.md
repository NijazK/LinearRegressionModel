# LinearRegressionModel
A simple linear regression is a way to model the linear relationship between two quantitative variables, using a line drawn through those variables' data points, known as a regression line.

## Purpose
Created a model to showcase the MPG vs Weight with a correlation matrix to test the response and precictor variables. For this example, 
a linear regression involving two variables, the response variable is the variable being modeled or predicted, while the predictor variable is 
the variable used to predict the response.
