# Linear Regressio nModel
A simple linear regression is a way to model the linear relationship between two quantitative variables, using a line drawn through those variables' data points, known as a regression line.

## Purpose
Created a model to showcase the MPG vs Weight with a correlation matrix to test the response and precictor variables. For this example, 
a linear regression involving two variables, the response variable is the variable being modeled or predicted, while the predictor variable is 
the variable used to predict the response. The linear regression model uses mpg as the response variable and weight as the predictor variable.
